- added `server.js` so the project can run locally with Node
- fixed the broken stylesheet path in `ui-showcase.html`
- refactored the main portfolio page structure
- improved the visual design of the home page
- cleaned up project data and links
- added a downloadable resume file
- added GitHub Pages deployment support
- added preview screenshots for the README
- updated the README to reflect the real repo

## How To Run Locally

### Option 1: Run with npm

From the project root:

```bash
cd "/Users/kyarah/Documents/MyPortafolio"
npm start
```

Then open:

[http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

### Development mode

If your Node version supports watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available npm Scripts

```bash
npm start
```

Starts the local Node server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the server in watch mode using Node.

## Routes

The local server supports:

You can test health quickly with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health
```

## Design Notes

The current design direction is:

- dark editorial-style landing page
- stronger hero composition
- cleaner project cards
- clearer contact section
- more honest project framing without fake demo promises

## Next Improvements

- replace the text resume with a polished PDF version
- add more real projects with public live demos
